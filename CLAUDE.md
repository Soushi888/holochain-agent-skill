# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repository Is

A vanilla agent skill for Holochain hApp development. It is a documentation-only repository — no Rust, no TypeScript, no build system. All files are Markdown. The skill is loaded by Claude Code when a user invokes `/holochain` or when Holochain-related work is detected.

**Documentation site:** The repo also generates a static documentation site via mdBook (`book.toml` + `SUMMARY.md`). Run `mdbook build` to produce `book/` (gitignored). GitHub Actions deploys it to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

**PAI-independence constraint:** This skill must work with zero PAI infrastructure (`~/.claude/PAI/` not required). No voice notification curls, no Algorithm routing, no PROJECTS.md references. All content must be self-contained.

**License:** Apache-2.0

## Routing Architecture

`SKILL.md` is the entry point. It contains:
1. A **Workflow Routing** table mapping natural-language triggers to `Workflows/*.md` files
2. A **Context Files** table specifying which `*.md` file to load per topic
3. **Quick Reference** — version pins and common commands

Context files are loaded **on demand**, not all at once. When editing `SKILL.md`, maintain this lazy-loading discipline.

## Version Pins (update all occurrences when bumping)

```
hdk = "=0.7.0"
hdi = "=0.8.0"
holonix ref=main-0.7
```

Exact pins (`=`) are required — Holochain is sensitive to minor version changes. When updating version pins, grep all files for the old version string and update every occurrence including `SKILL.md` Quick Reference, `Architecture.md` workspace examples, and any code blocks in context files.

## Maintaining the Skill

- **Code examples must compile** — validate against the hAppenings or Nondominium codebase before committing new examples
- **HDK 0.6 breaking changes** — `delete_link()` now requires `GetOptions::default()` as second argument; `GetLinksInputBuilder` replaced the old `LinkQuery::new()` in some contexts (see `Patterns.md` for the authoritative API)
- **No duplication across files** — each pattern lives in one canonical file; `SKILL.md` routes to it
- **Workflow files** in `Workflows/` are step-by-step sequences; context files (`Architecture.md`, `Patterns.md`, etc.) are reference material. Keep these roles distinct
- **docs/ is not part of the skill** — `docs/requirements.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` are project tracking, not loaded by skill routing

## Key Architectural Concepts (for editing context files accurately)

- Every Holochain domain = one integrity crate (`hdi`) + one coordinator crate (`hdk`)
- Integrity code is locked to the DNA hash; coordinator code can be hot-swapped post-deployment
- Validation in integrity must be **pure/deterministic**: no `get()`, no `agent_info()`, no time comparisons
- Update chain tracking: `create_link(original_hash, updated_action_hash, LinkTypes::MyEntryUpdates)` — always link from original, never chain links
- `post_commit` is infallible — must use `#[hdk_extern(infallible)]`
- `send_remote_signal` is fire-and-forget; `recv_remote_signal` requires an unrestricted cap grant in `init()`
