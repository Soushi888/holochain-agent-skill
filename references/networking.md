# Networking and Conductor Configuration (0.7)

Everything here is read from `holochain_conductor_api 0.7.0` (`src/config/conductor.rs`), `holochain_p2p 0.7.0` (`Cargo.toml`) and `kitsune2_bootstrap_srv 0.5.0`. If a field is not listed here, check those sources rather than guessing: `ConductorConfig` is `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so an invented key is a startup error, not a silent no-op.

## What changed in 0.7

The whole transport layer was replaced.

| 0.6 | 0.7 |
|---|---|
| tx5 / WebRTC transport, optional `transport-iroh` feature | iroh over QUIC, unconditional. `grep tx5 holochain_p2p/Cargo.toml` returns nothing |
| `signal_url` pointing at an SBD signal server | `relay_url` pointing at an iroh relay |
| `webrtc_config` | gone. Use `advanced` for direct Kitsune2 tuning |
| `transport-iroh` cargo feature on the `holochain` crate | removed. `holochain_p2p` enables `kitsune2/transport-iroh` and `iroh-relay` itself |

Kitsune2 is at `0.5.0` for the whole 0.7.0 line: `kitsune2_api`, `kitsune2_core` and `kitsune2_transport_iroh` all pin `0.5.0`.

Client-side, the per-connection `is_webrtc` flag became `is_direct`. See `client.md`.

## Minimal conductor config

This is the example from the `holochain_conductor_api` module documentation, unedited:

```yaml
---
## Configure the keystore to be used.
keystore:
  ## Use an in-process keystore with default database location.
  type: lair_server_in_proc

## Configure an admin WebSocket interface at a specific port.
admin_interfaces:
  - driver:
      type: websocket
      port: 1234
      allowed_origins: "*"

## Configure the network.
network:
  ## Use the Holochain-provided dev-test bootstrap server.
  bootstrap_url: https://dev-test-bootstrap2.holochain.org

  ## Use the iroh relay server.
  relay_url: https://use1-1.relay.n0.iroh-canary.iroh.link./
```

`allowed_origins` is not optional and not defaulted. A browser UI that gets no response from the admin or app port is usually being rejected on origin, not on port.

## `NetworkConfig`, field by field

Serialized under `network:` in `conductor-config.yaml`, `snake_case`, unknown fields rejected.

| Field | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bootstrap_url` | URL | `https://dev-test-bootstrap2.holochain.org` | The Kitsune2 bootstrap server used for WAN peer discovery |
| `relay_url` | URL | `https://use1-1.relay.n0.iroh-canary.iroh.link./` | The iroh relay used when a direct connection cannot be established |
| `base64_auth_material_bootstrap` | `Option<String>` | none | Auth material if your bootstrap service requires it. Base64 url-safe, no padding |
| `base64_auth_material_relay` | `Option<String>` | none | Same, for the relay service |
| `request_timeout_s` | `u64` | `60` | Request/response roundtrip timeout, in seconds |
| `target_arc_factor` | `u32` | `1` | Multiplier applied to arc-size hints from Kitsune2 |
| `report` | `ReportConfig` | `None` | Kitsune2 reporting output |
| `advanced` | `Option<JSON>` | none | Raw Kitsune2 module config. Every field above is sugar over a key in here |

### The two defaults you should not ship with

`dev-test-bootstrap2.holochain.org` is named "dev-test" for a reason, and the default relay is an iroh **canary** host. Both are fine for development and neither is a production commitment by anyone. A hApp you distribute should point at infrastructure you or your community controls. See "Running your own bootstrap server" below.

### `request_timeout_s` sets three timeouts, not one

Setting it derives two more values, per the field's own documentation:

```
request_timeout_s              = 60   (what you set)
single transport message       = 30   floor(1/2 of request_timeout_s)
direct-connection attempt      = 22   floor(3/8 of request_timeout_s), before falling back to relay
```

So halving the request timeout also halves how long a peer waits before giving up on a direct connection and paying the relay's latency. Tune it as one number with three consequences.

The 0.7 source still calls the third value the "webrtc connection" timeout in its doc comment. That is leftover wording from the tx5 era. The mechanism is iroh's direct-path attempt before relay fallback.

### `target_arc_factor` and leecher nodes

`1` is normal operation: honour Kitsune2's arc-size hints as given. Set it to `0` for a node that should not contribute to gossip at all, which the field documentation calls a "leecher node".

A zero-arc node still reads from the DHT, but it stores nothing on behalf of the network. That is a legitimate configuration for a mobile or ephemeral client, and a bad one for the majority of a network's nodes: if everyone leeches, nobody holds the data.

### `report`

```yaml
network:
  report:
    type: json_lines
    days_retained: 7
    fetched_op_interval_s: 60
```

Two variants only: `None` (the default, no reporting) and `JsonLines { days_retained, fetched_op_interval_s }`. Useful when diagnosing gossip behaviour over hours rather than seconds.

### `advanced`

Direct Kitsune2 module configuration, as raw JSON. The named fields above are merged into it at startup: `bootstrap_url` becomes the `serverUrl` key of the `core_bootstrap` module, and so on. Anything you set directly in `advanced` for the same key is what the named field overwrites, so do not set both.

Use it only when you know which Kitsune2 module you are configuring. Module names seen in the 0.7 sources include `k2Gossip` (with keys like `initiateIntervalMs`) and the bootstrap module's `serverUrl`.

## Test-only network switches

`disable_bootstrap`, `disable_publish` and `disable_gossip` exist on `NetworkConfig` but are gated behind the `test-utils` cargo feature. They are how Sweettest builds isolated networks. They are not available on a stock conductor binary, and a config file naming them will fail to parse.

## Running your own bootstrap server

The server is a standalone binary, `kitsune2-bootstrap-srv`, shipped by the `kitsune2_bootstrap_srv` crate (`0.5.0` for the 0.7 line).

```
cargo install kitsune2_bootstrap_srv --version 0.5.0 --locked
kitsune2-bootstrap-srv --production --listen 0.0.0.0:443 --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem
```

It runs in a **testing** configuration by default, with deliberately light resource settings, and switches to production settings only with `--production`:

| Setting | Testing | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `--listen` | `127.0.0.1:0` | `0.0.0.0:443` and `[::]:443` |
| `--worker-thread-count` | 2 | 4 x cpu count |
| `--request-listen-duration-ms` | 10ms | 2s |
| `--prune-interval-ms` | 10s | 60s |
| `--max-entries-per-space` | 32 | 32 |

`--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` require each other, both PEM encoded. `--allowed-origins` defaults to allowing any origin. `--json` switches tracing output to JSON.

A bootstrap server holds nothing but agent info: it is how peers find each other, not where data lives. Losing it partitions new joiners, not existing peers who already know each other.

The relay is a separate concern. Holochain uses iroh's relay protocol, so any iroh relay will do, including one you run yourself.

## Other conductor config fields worth knowing

From `ConductorConfig` in the same file:

| Field | Note |
|---|---|
| `data_root_path` | Databases and compiled wasm live under here. Required by the time the config builds a conductor |
| `keystore` | `lair_server_in_proc` for a self-contained conductor, or a separate lair server |
| `admin_interfaces` | A list of `{ driver: { type: websocket, port, allowed_origins } }`. Omit in production if nothing should manage the conductor remotely |
| `wasm_backend` | Only needed when more than one wasm backend is compiled in |
| `db_sync_level` | SQLite `PRAGMA synchronous`. Leave alone unless you have measured a reason |
| `db_max_readers` | Defaults to twice the CPU count, minimum 8. Related to the authority-response concurrency limit; change both or neither |
| `tracing_override` | Overrides the environment tracing config. See `debugging.md` |
